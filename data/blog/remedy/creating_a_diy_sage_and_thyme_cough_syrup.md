# Creating a DIY Sage and Thyme Cough Syrup

In the ancient arsenal of natural remedies, sage (*Salvia officinalis*) and thyme (*Thymus vulgaris*) stand out as potent herbs blessed with therapeutic virtues. This blog post will guide you through the sacred process of creating a DIY Sage and Thyme Cough Syrup, combining shamanic wisdom with scientific profundity.

## Why Sage and Thyme?

### Sage (*Salvia officinalis*)

- **Antimicrobial Properties:** Sage contains compounds like rosmarinic acid and carnosic acid, which exhibit potent antimicrobial properties.
- **Anti-inflammatory Effects:** It helps reduce throat inflammation, a common symptom associated with coughs.
- **Rich in Antioxidants:** Sage is packed with antioxidants, which help battle oxidative stress and promote overall well-being.

### Thyme (*Thymus vulgaris*)

- **Expectorant Properties:** Thyme aids in loosening and expelling mucus, offering relief from chest congestion.
- **Antibacterial Action:** Thymol, a key compound in thyme, is effective in combating bacteria that may cause respiratory infections.
- **Immune Boost:** Rich in vitamins and minerals, thyme strengthens the immune system.

## Ingredients

- 1/2 cup of fresh sage leaves or 1/4 cup dried sage
- 1/2 cup of fresh thyme leaves or 1/4 cup dried thyme
- 1 cup of raw honey
- 1 lemon
- 2 cups of water

## Tools

- A small saucepan
- A fine sieve or cheesecloth
- A glass jar with a lid
- A wooden spoon

## Instructions

### Step 1: Prepare Your Herbs

1. **Rinse** the fresh sage and thyme thoroughly under cold water to remove any dirt or impurities.
2. **Gently pat dry** the herbs using a clean towel.

### Step 2: Create the Herbal Infusion

1. **Combine water and herbs:** Pour the 2 cups of water into the saucepan and add the sage and thyme.
2. **Heat and Simmer:** Bring the water to a boil. Reduce the heat and allow the herbs to simmer gently for 15-20 minutes. This will extract the beneficial compounds from the herbs.
3. **Strain the infusion:** After simmering, use the fine sieve or cheesecloth to strain the liquid into a clean bowl. Discard the spent herbs.

### Step 3: Mix in Honey and Lemon

1. **Add Honey:** Pour the herbal infusion back into the saucepan. Add the raw honey and stir gently over low heat until the honey is fully dissolved. Ensure the mixture does not boil to preserve the enzymatic properties of the honey.
2. **Add Lemon Juice:** Squeeze the lemon and add its juice to the mixture. Stir well. Lemon adds not just flavor, but also vitamin C and additional antimicrobial properties.

### Step 4: Store and Use

1. **Transfer to Jar:** Once the mixture is well combined and slightly cooled, pour it into your glass jar. Ensure the jar is sterile.
2. **Label and Store:** Label the jar with the contents and date. Store in the refrigerator, where it should keep for up to 2 months.

## Dosage and Use

Take 1-2 teaspoons of your DIY Sage and Thyme Cough Syrup every 3-4 hours as needed. For children, the dosage should be adjusted to 1/2 - 1 teaspoon. Always consult a healthcare provider before starting any new remedy, especially for young children or individuals with pre-existing health conditions.
