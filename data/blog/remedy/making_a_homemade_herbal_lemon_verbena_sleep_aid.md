# Making a Homemade Herbal Lemon Verbena Sleep Aid

Welcome, dear seekers of holistic well-being. Today, we journey into the soothing realm of herbal remedies, exploring the art of crafting a homemade sleep aid featuring the serene Lemon Verbena. This plant, steeped in shamanic tradition and grounded in its scientifically-proven attributes, serves as a gentle guide to tranquil nights and restful slumbers.

## The Sacred Herb: Lemon Verbena

Lemon Verbena (_Aloysia citrodora_) is revered for its powerful calming and sleep-inducing properties. Known to herbalists and healers alike, this fragrant plant works synergistically with our bodies to promote serene sleep. The active constituents, including citral and verbascoside, make it a potent ally in the battle against insomnia and restlessness.

### Why Lemon Verbena?

1. **Calmative Effects:** Lemon Verbena’s essential oils are known to offer anxiolytic (anxiety-reducing) properties, helping to calm the nervous system.
2. **Anti-inflammatory Benefits:** Its ability to reduce inflammation can alleviate physical discomfort that hinders restful sleep.
3. **Digestive Aid:** By promoting gentle digestion, Lemon Verbena reduces gastrointestinal issues that might interrupt sleep.

## Harvesting and Preparing Lemon Verbena

### Step 1: Harvesting

For optimal potency, harvest Lemon Verbena leaves in the morning after the dew has evaporated but before the heat of midday. Select vibrant, green leaves free from blemishes.

### Step 2: Drying

1. **Air Drying:** Bundle leaves together with twine, hanging them upside down in a dry, ventilated space. Ensure they are out of direct sunlight to preserve their aromatic oils.
2. **Dehydrator:** Place leaves in a single layer on dehydrator trays, setting the temperature between 95°F and 115°F. This method ensures even drying and potency retention.

### Step 3: Storing

Once completely dry, store the leaves in an airtight container, away from light and moisture.
