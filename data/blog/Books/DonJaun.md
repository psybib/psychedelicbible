## The Power of Plant Allies 🌿🌵🍄

Central to Don Juan's teachings is the use of sacred plant allies, which serve as guides and catalysts for spiritual growth. Each plant ally has its own unique properties and significance:

   - Significance: Datura is seen as a powerful ally that can help the user confront their fears and access hidden knowledge.
   - Preparation: The roots and seeds of the datura plant are ground into a paste and applied topically or consumed in small doses. Don Juan emphasizes the importance of proper dosage and respect for this potent plant.

3. **Mushrooms** (Psilocybe species) 🍄:

Don Juan guides Castaneda through various rituals and practices designed to help him break free from the limitations of ordinary reality and access the world of shamanic power:
