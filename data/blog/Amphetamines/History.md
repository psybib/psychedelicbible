# A Brief History of Amphetamines: From Medicine to Misuse

## Introduction

Amphetamines, a class of psychostimulant drugs, have a long and complex history dating back over a century. Originally developed for medical purposes, amphetamines have seen widespread use and misuse throughout the decades, shaping society in profound ways. This post explores the key milestones in the history of these powerful substances.

## The Early Days: Synthesis and Medical Applications

### 1887: The Birth of Amphetamine

Amphetamine, the parent compound of this drug class, was first synthesized in 1887 by Romanian chemist LazÄƒr Edeleanu at the University of Berlin. However, its psychoactive properties were not recognized until the 1920s.

### 1920s-1930s: Early Medical Uses 

In 1928, biochemist Gordon Alles resynthesized amphetamine while searching for a cheaper and less toxic alternative to ephedrine. By the 1930s, pharmaceutical company Smith, Kline & French began marketing amphetamine as a decongestant inhaler under the brand name Benzedrine.

Amphetamines were soon prescribed for a wide range of conditions, including:
- Narcolepsy
- Depression
- Obesity
- Nasal congestion

## World War II: Widespread Military Use

During World War II, amphetamines were extensively used by military personnel on all sides to combat fatigue, boost alertness, and enhance performance. Millions of tablets were distributed to troops, leading to widespread exposure and popularity.

## Post-War Period: Recreational Use and Abuse

### 1950s: The Rise of Recreational Use

After the war, surplus supplies of amphetamines found their way into civilian hands. Recreational use surged, particularly among students, truck drivers, and athletes seeking increased energy and focus.

### 1960s: The Hippie Era and Cultural Influence

In the 1960s, amphetamines became intertwined with the counterculture movement. Substances like "Dexies" (dextroamphetamine) and methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) gained popularity for their euphoric and empathogenic effects.

## Regulation and Illicit Manufacturing

### 1970s: Controlled Substances Act

Recognizing the growing problem of amphetamine abuse, the United States government passed the Controlled Substances Act in 1970. This law classified amphetamines as Schedule II drugs, restricting their manufacture, distribution, and possession.

### Clandestine Laboratories and Designer Drugs

As legal access to amphetamines diminished, illicit manufacturing in clandestine laboratories took hold. The 1980s and 1990s saw a proliferation of designer drugs, including MDMA, methcathinone, and 4-methylaminorex, created to skirt drug laws.

## Present Day: Methamphetamine Epidemic and Therapeutic Resurgence

### The Methamphetamine Crisis

In recent years, the illicit production and abuse of methamphetamine has reached epidemic proportions, particularly in rural America. Meth's highly addictive nature and devastating health consequences have made it a major public health concern.

### Therapeutic Potential Revisited

Despite their checkered past, amphetamines are experiencing a resurgence in medical research. Controlled studies are exploring their potential in treating conditions like ADHD, narcolepsy, and even PTSD, albeit with strict regulations and oversight.

## Conclusion

The history of amphetamines is a cautionary tale of how substances with legitimate medical uses can spiral into widespread misuse and societal harm when not properly regulated. As we grapple with the ongoing challenges posed by amphetamines, it is crucial to strike a balance between harnessing their therapeutic potential and mitigating their risks. Only through informed policy, public education, and compassionate addiction treatment can we hope to break the cycle of amphetamine abuse.
