Quevedo was born on _September 17, 1580_, in Madrid, Spain. He was born into a noble family and received an excellent education, studying at the Imperial College of Madrid and the University of Alcal√°. He was fluent in several languages, including Latin, Greek, and Hebrew.

Throughout his life, Quevedo was involved in politics and held various positions in the Spanish court. He served as a diplomat and was a close advisor to the Duke of Osuna, the Viceroy of Naples. However, his political career was marked by controversy, and he was imprisoned several times due to his involvement in political intrigues.

Despite his tumultuous political career, Quevedo is best known for his literary works. He was a prolific writer, and his works spanned various genres, including poetry, prose, and drama. He is considered one of the masters of conceptismo, a literary style characterized by concise, complex, and witty expressions.

Quevedo's most famous work is "El Busc√≥n," a picaresque novel that follows the adventures of a young man from a poor background who tries to rise in society through deception and trickery. The novel is a scathing critique of Spanish society and is known for its biting satire and dark humor.

Quevedo's poetry is also highly regarded, and he is considered one of the greatest poets of the Spanish Golden Age. His poems are known for their wit, wordplay, and satirical elements. Some of his most famous poems include "Amor constante m√°s all√° de la muerte" and "Poderoso caballero es don Dinero."

Quevedo died on _September 8, 1645_, in Villanueva de los Infantes, Spain. Despite facing numerous challenges and setbacks throughout his life, he left behind a rich literary legacy that continues to be celebrated and studied to this day.
