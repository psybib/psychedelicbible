# How to Make a Natural Herbal Mouthwash with Sage and Thyme

Greetings, Earth Healers and Wisdom Seekers! Today, we delve into the harmonizing world of herbal remedies to uncover the alchemical treasure that is a natural herbal mouthwash using sage and thyme. With roots in ancient healing practices and backed by contemporary science, this mouthwash not only refreshes but also fortifies oral health.

## Why Choose Sage and Thyme?

Sage (_Salvia officinalis_) and thyme (_Thymus vulgaris_) have long been revered in traditional medicine for their potent antiseptic, antibacterial, and anti-inflammatory properties. Here’s why these herbs are your perfect allies for a natural mouthwash:

- **Sage**: Highly effective against oral pathogens, sage is known for its ability to soothe the mucous membranes, thus alleviating throat discomfort and reducing gum inflammation.
- **Thyme**: With its high thymol content, thyme acts as a formidable antimicrobial agent, making it excellent for maintaining a healthy oral microbiome.

## Ingredients

To craft this magical elixir, gather the following ingredients:

- 1 tablespoon dried sage leaves
- 1 tablespoon dried thyme leaves
- 2 cups distilled water
- 1 teaspoon sea salt (optional but recommended)
- 10 drops of peppermint essential oil or another essential oil of your choice (optional)

## Instructions

### 1. Preparing Your Herbal Base

1. **Boil the Water**: Begin by bringing the distilled water to a rolling boil. Using distilled water ensures that no impurities alter the efficacy of your herbal mouthwash.

### 2. Infusing the Herbs

2. **Add Herbs**: Once the water is boiling, add the dried sage and thyme leaves.
3. **Simmer**: Reduce the heat and allow the mixture to simmer for about 15-20 minutes. This allows for the full extraction of essential oils and beneficial compounds from the herbs.

### 3. Straining the Infusion

4. **Cool Down**: Turn off the heat and let the mixture cool to a comfortable room temperature.
5. **Strain**: Using a fine mesh strainer or cheesecloth, strain the mixture to remove all solid particles. What you have now is a concentrated herbal infusion.

### 4. Enhancing the Mouthwash

6. **Add Sea Salt**: Dissolve the sea salt into the strained infusion. Salt adds an extra layer of antimicrobial action and helps soothe any oral irritations.
7. **Essential Oil**: If you prefer a minty finish and enhanced antiseptic properties, add 10 drops of peppermint essential oil. 

### 5. Storing Your Mouthwash

8. **Bottle It Up**: Pour the finished mouthwash into a sterilized glass bottle with a tight-fitting lid. Mason jars or amber glass bottles work exceptionally well.

## Usage and Shelf Life

* **Directions**: Use the mouthwash twice daily, swishing around the mouth for at least 30 seconds before spitting out. Do not swallow.
* **Storage**: Store in a cool, dark place. The mouthwash can last up to a week. If you notice any strange smells, it's time to make a new batch.

## Scientific Backing

Studies have shown that both sage and thyme possess significant antimicrobial properties, effective against various oral pathogens. A study published in the *Journal of Applied Microbiology* (2016) highlighted the potent antibacterial activity of thymol and carvacrol—the primary constituents of thyme essential oil—against *Streptococcus mutans*, one of the main bacteria implicated in tooth decay.

Another paper in the *Journal of Ethnopharmacology* (2015) emphasized sage's ability to alleviate sore throats and oral inflammations due to its rich content of rosmarinic acid and flavonoids.

## A Return to Nature

Incorporating this herbal mouthwash into your daily routine is not merely about oral hygiene; it's an act of honoring the harmonious relationship with the Earth’s healing gifts. As you swish, let the ancient energies of sage and thyme cleanse not just your mouth but your spirit as well.

May your journey to holistic wellness be ever blossoming.

Blessings and Health,
*Your Holistic Healer*
