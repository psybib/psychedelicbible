## Step-by-Step Process

### Step 1: Prepare Calendula Infused Oil
To truly maximize the healing properties of calendula, we first need to create an infused oil.
1. **Ingredients:**
   - 1 cup dried calendula flowers
   - 2 cups sweet almond oil

2. **Process:**
   1. Place the dried calendula flowers in a clean, dry jar.
   2. Pour the sweet almond oil over the flowers, ensuring they are fully submerged.
   3. Seal the jar and place it in a sunny spot for 4-6 weeks, shaking gently every few days.
   4. After the infusion period, strain the oil through a fine sieve or cheesecloth into a clean container.

### Step 2: Melting the Base
1. Using a double boiler, melt:
   - 2 tablespoons of beeswax pellets
   - 1/4 cup shea butter

2. Once melted, remove from heat and let cool slightly but not solidify.

### Step 3: Combining the Oils
1. Slowly add:
   - 1/4 cup jojoba oil
   - 1/2 cup calendula infused oil
   - Stir consistently to blend well.

### Step 4: Infusing the Lavender
1. Stir in 10-15 drops of lavender essential oil to the mixture.
2. For an enhanced floral touch, you may add 1 teaspoon of dried lavender flowers. Remember, this is optional and for those who prefer texture in their creams.

### Step 5: Mixing and Cooling
1. Continue stirring the mixture as it cools to ensure all ingredients are well combined.
2. Pour the cream into sterilized glass jars while still liquid for easy transfer.

### Step 6: Storage and Use
1. Store the jars in a cool, dark place to preserve the integrity of the ingredients.
2. To use, apply a small amount to the face after cleansing. Massage gently in circular motions to boost circulation and ensure deeper absorption.

## Tips for Best Results

- Always perform a patch test before using any new skincare product to check for allergic reactions.
- For those with particularly dry skin, consider adding a few drops of vitamin E oil to the blend.
- This face cream can alternatively be used as a soothing balm for any part of the body that needs extra hydration.

Calendula and lavender create a symphony of natural healing, where calendula's anti-inflammatory prowess meets lavender's calming and antiseptic strength. By combining these botanical wonders into a luxurious face cream, you offer your skin not just hydration, but a deep, restorative therapy.
