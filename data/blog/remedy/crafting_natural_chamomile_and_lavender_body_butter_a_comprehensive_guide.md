## Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1: Infusion of Chamomile
To harness chamomile’s full potential, we start by infusing it into our carrier oil.

1. **Ingredients**: 1 cup of coconut oil, 2 tablespoons of dried chamomile flowers.
2. **Method**: 
   - Place the chamomile flowers and coconut oil in a double boiler.
   - Heat gently for about 1-2 hours, ensuring the temperature remains low to preserve the chamomile's beneficial properties.
   - Strain the mixture using a fine mesh sieve or cheesecloth to remove the plant material, leaving you with a wonderfully fragrant chamomile-infused oil.

### Step 2: Melting and Blending
Next, we combine our key ingredients to form the base of the body butter.

1. **Ingredients**: Chamomile-infused coconut oil, 1 cup shea butter, 1/4 cup beeswax, 2 tablespoons jojoba oil.
2. **Method**:
   - In a double boiler, melt the shea butter and beeswax slowly.
   - Once melted, add the chamomile-infused coconut oil and jojoba oil. Stir to combine.
   - Remove from heat and let it cool slightly.

### Step 3: Essential Oil Enhancement
Now, we’ll add essential oils to elevate the therapeutic profile of our body butter.

1. **Ingredients**: 10 drops of lavender essential oil, 10 drops of chamomile essential oil, 1 teaspoon of vitamin E oil.
2. **Method**:
   - Add the essential oils and vitamin E to the melted mixture.
   - Stir thoroughly to ensure even distribution.

### Step 4: Whipping the Butter
Whipping infuses the body butter with air, giving it a luxurious, fluffy texture.

1. **Method**:
   - Let the mixture cool until it begins to solidify but is still quite soft (a consistency like softened butter).
   - Using a hand mixer, whip the mixture on high speed for about 5-10 minutes until it achieves a light and airy consistency.

### Step 5: Storing the Body Butter
Proper storage ensures longevity and maintains the butter’s efficacy.

1. **Method**:
   - Transfer the body butter into sterilized glass jars.
   - Label the jars with the date of creation.
   - Store in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight.

## Application and Enjoyment

To use, simply scoop a small amount of the body butter and massage it into your skin. Enjoy the soothing blend of chamomile and lavender as it hydrates and nourishes your skin, making it feel soft and rejuvenated.
