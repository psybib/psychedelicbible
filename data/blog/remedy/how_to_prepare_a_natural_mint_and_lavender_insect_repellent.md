# How to Prepare a Natural Mint and Lavender Insect Repellent

In a world teeming with synthetic chemicals, harnessing the ancient wisdom of plant-based remedies provides a serene return to nature's embrace. Today, we delve into crafting a natural insect repellent using the mighty duo: mint and lavender. This concoction not only protects but soothes the soul through its aromatic presence.

## Ingredients

To begin our journey, gather the following primary ingredients:

- **Fresh Mint Leaves:** 1 cup, chopped
- **Lavender Essential Oil:** 15-20 drops
- **Witch Hazel:** 1 cup
- **Distilled Water:** 1 cup
- **Vegetable Glycerin (optional):** 1 tablespoon for added moisturizing

## Equipment

Ensure you have these essential tools:

- **Two glass jars** – One for steeping mint leaves and another for mixing the final solution.
- **A spray bottle** – Preferably dark glass to preserve the essential oils from light degradation.
- **A funnel** – For easy transfer of liquids.
- **A cheesecloth or fine strainer** – To filter the plant material.

## Preparation Steps

### 1. Prepare the Mint Infusion

Begin by creating a mint infusion, which will serve as the potent foundation of our repellent.

- **Chop the Mint:** Finely chop the fresh mint leaves to expose as many cell surfaces as possible.
- **Steep Mint Leaves:** Place the chopped mint leaves into one of the glass jars. Pour boiling distilled water over the leaves ensuring they are fully submerged.
- **Cover and Let Cool:** Cover the jar with a lid and allow the mixture to cool to room temperature. This process typically takes about 1-2 hours.
- **Strain the Infusion:** Using a cheesecloth or fine strainer, filter the liquid to remove all solid plant material. Transfer the clear infusion to a clean jar.

### 2. Mixing the Repellent

Now, let's blend our infusion with the remaining ingredients to create the repellent.

- **Combine Liquids:** In the clean glass jar, mix the mint infusion with the witch hazel. Witch hazel acts as an astringent and helps to soothe your skin while repelling insects.
- **Add Essential Oil:** Add 15-20 drops of lavender essential oil into the mixture. Lavender is known for its calming scent and potent insect-repelling properties.
- **Optional Addition:** Stir in a tablespoon of vegetable glycerin if you desire a moisturizing element.

### 3. Transfer to Spray Bottle

With your repellent mixture prepared, it’s time for final packaging.

- **Use a Funnel:** Place a funnel in the neck of your dark glass spray bottle.
- **Pour Mixture:** Carefully pour the repellent mixture into the spray bottle from the mixing jar.
- **Seal and Label:** Seal the spray bottle with its cap and label it with the contents and date for future reference.

## Application and Storage

Apply your homemade mint and lavender insect repellent to exposed skin and clothing before heading outdoors. For optimal efficacy:

- **Shake Well Before Use:** Essential oils may separate from the liquid base; a good shake ensures an even mixture.
- **Reapply as Necessary:** Depending on physical activity and environmental conditions, reapply every 2-3 hours.

Store your repellent in a cool, dark place away from direct sunlight. Properly stored, it should maintain effectiveness for up to six months.
