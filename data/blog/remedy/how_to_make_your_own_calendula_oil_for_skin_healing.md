# How to Make Your Own Calendula Oil for Skin Healing

Calendula, also known as marigold, has been used for centuries in traditional medicine for its profound skin healing properties. Today, its efficacy is supported by modern science, which recognizes its anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, and wound-healing capabilities. In this blog post, we'll delve into the process of making your own calendula oil, a versatile remedy that can soothe a variety of skin issues.

## Ingredients and Tools Needed

Before we embark on this journey, let's gather the necessary ingredients and tools:

### Ingredients

1. **Dried Calendula Flowers**: Ideally, organically grown.
2. **Carrier Oil**: Olive oil, almond oil, or jojoba oil are excellent choices.
3. **Optional Additives**: Essential oils such as lavender or tea tree for added benefits.

### Tools

1. **Glass Jar**: A mason jar or any clean, sterilized glass jar.
2. **Strainer or Cheesecloth**: For filtering the oil.
3. **Dark Glass Bottle**: For storing the finished calendula oil.
4. **Label**: To record the date and contents.

## Step-by-Step Tutorial

### Step 1: Selecting and Preparing Calendula Flowers

Choosing high-quality dried calendula flowers is crucial. Ensure the flowers are fully dried to prevent mold growth in the oil. If you prefer, you can dry your own flowers by harvesting fresh calendula and leaving them in a well-ventilated, shaded area until crispy.

### Step 2: Choosing the Right Carrier Oil

Carrier oils provide a medium in which the calendula properties can infuse. For skin healing, olive oil is highly recommended due to its nutrient-rich composition. However, almond and jojoba oils are also excellent for their skin-soothing and moisturizing properties.

### Step 3: Infusing the Calendula Flowers

#### Traditional Method (Solar Infusion)

1. **Fill the Jar**: Place dried calendula flowers in the glass jar, filling it about halfway.
2. **Add Carrier Oil**: Pour the carrier oil over the flowers until the jar is nearly full. Ensure the flowers are completely submerged.
3. **Seal the Jar**: Tightly close the jar and place it on a sunny windowsill.
4. **Infusion Period**: Allow the jar to infuse for 4-6 weeks. Shake it gently every few days to ensure even infusion.
   
#### Quick Method (Heat Infusion)

1. **Double Boiler Setup**: Place the jar with calendula and carrier oil in a double boiler.
2. **Low Heat**: Gently heat the oil on low for 2-3 hours, ensuring the oil does not reach a high temperature.
3. **Monitoring**: Stir occasionally and monitor the oil to prevent overheating.

### Step 4: Straining the Oil

After the infusion period, whether using the solar or heat method:

1. **Strain**: Using a cheesecloth or fine strainer, pour the oil into a clean bowl, separating the flowers from the oil.
2. **Press**: Squeeze the cheesecloth to extract as much oil as possible.
3. **Second Strain (Optional)**: For ultra-clear oil, strain a second time using a finer cloth.

### Step 5: Bottling and Storing

1. **Transfer**: Pour the strained oil into a dark glass bottle to protect it from light.
2. **Label**: Clearly label the bottle with the date and contents.
3. **Storage**: Store in a cool, dark place. Properly stored, the calendula oil can last up to one year.

## Using Calendula Oil for Skin Healing

Calendula oil can be applied directly to the skin or used as an ingredient in homemade balms, creams, and lotions. Its applications include:

- **Wound Healing**: Apply directly to cuts, scrapes, and minor wounds to accelerate healing.
- **Eczema and Dermatitis**: Soothe irritated skin by gently massaging the oil into affected areas.
- **Sunburn Relief**: Use as a cooling balm for sunburn recovery.
- **Moisturizing**: Incorporate into daily skincare routines for its emollient properties.

## Precautions and Considerations

While calendula oil is generally safe for most individuals, it is essential to conduct a patch test before widespread application, especially for those with allergies to the Asteraceae (daisy) family. Avoid using calendula oil on deep wounds or severe burns without professional medical advice.

## Conclusion

Making your own calendula oil is both a rewarding and healing endeavor, connecting the wisdom of natural remedies with scientifically-backed techniques. By following these steps, youâ€™ll have a potent, homemade remedy ready to harness the skin-healing powers of calendula.

Happy Healing!
