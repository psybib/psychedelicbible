## Equipment

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Prepare Your Ingredients
1. **Dried Herbs**: Measure out equal parts of lavender, chamomile, and rose petals. A common starting point is 1/4 cup each.
2. **Epsom Salts**: Use 2 cups as your base.
3. **Essential Oils**: Use 5-10 drops each of lavender, chamomile, and eucalyptus oils.
4. **Carrier Oils**: Mix 2 tablespoons of your chosen carrier oil into the Epsom salts.

### 2. Mixing Herbs and Salts
1. In a large mixing bowl, combine Epsom salts with dried herbs.
2. Add the carrier oil and essential oils. Stir well with a wooden spoon to evenly disperse the oils throughout the salt and herb mixture.

### 3. Preparation of Muslin Bags
1. Cut cheesecloth or use pre-made muslin bags.
2. Spoon the herbal blend into the center of the cheesecloth or into the muslin bags.
3. Tie tightly with a string if using cheesecloth, ensuring no herbs can escape.

### 4. Storage
1. Store the prepared herbal bath soak in a glass jar.
2. Keep the jar in a cool, dark place to preserve the potency of the essential oils and herbs.

### 5. Usage
1. When ready to use, place one muslin bag under warm running bath water.
2. Let it steep for a few minutes, similar to how you'd brew tea, allowing the warm water to draw out the beneficial properties.
3. Soak in the bath for at least 20 minutes to fully absorb the benefits.

## Recommended Practices for Maximum Benefits

### Ritual Preparation
Before your bath, create a calm environment. Dim the lights, light some incense or candles, and play soft, serene music. This will set the stage for your herbal soak experience.

### Mindful Soaking
As you immerse yourself in the bath, practice deep, mindful breathing. Focus on the scent and sensations. Allow the warm water and herbal infusion to envelop you, releasing tension from your muscles and mind.

### Post-Bath Care
After your soak, pat your skin dry gently with a soft towel. Follow with a natural moisturizer to lock in hydration. Consider applying a few drops of the same essential oils used in your bath soak for prolonged relaxation effects.
