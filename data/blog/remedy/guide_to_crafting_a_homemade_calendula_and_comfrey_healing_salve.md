# Guide to Crafting a Homemade Calendula and Comfrey Healing Salve

In the ancient world, healers and shamans relied on the abundant gifts of nature to craft remedies that soothed and healed. Today, we blend this shamanic wisdom with modern medical understanding to create our own treatments. This guide will take you through the process of crafting a powerful healing salve using calendula and comfrey. Both plants have been revered for their potent medicinal properties, and when combined, they can form a salve that aids in wound healing, reduces inflammation, and promotes skin health.

## Why Choose Calendula and Comfrey?

### Calendula Officinalis (Marigold)

Calendula flowers are known for their bright yellow-orange petals and have been used medicinally for centuries. They contain:

- **Flavonoids and Saponins**: These compounds provide anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties.
- **Triterpenoids**: Promotes wound healing and reduces inflammation.
- **Carotenoids**: Antioxidants that support skin health.

### Symphytum Officinale (Comfrey)

Comfrey has a long history of use in traditional medicine due to its healing abilities. Its noteworthy components include:

- **Allantoin**: Promotes cell regeneration and accelerates the healing process.
- **Rosmarinic Acid**: Provides anti-inflammatory and pain-relief benefits.
- **Mucilage**: Soothes and protects irritated tissues.

## Materials Needed

### Ingredients

- **Dried Calendula Flowers:** 1 cup
- **Dried Comfrey Leaves:** 1 cup
- **Olive Oil or Almond Oil:** 2 cups
- **Beeswax Pastilles:** 1/4 cup
- **Essential Oils (optional):** Lavender or Tea Tree Oil for additional benefits

### Equipment

- **Double Boiler:** For gentle heating
- **Mason Jars:** For oil infusion
- **Cheesecloth or Fine Mesh Strainer:** To strain herbal material
- **Sterile Containers:** For storing the finished salve

## Step-by-Step Guide to Making the Salve

### 1. Infusing the Oil

To extract the beneficial properties of calendula and comfrey into the oil:

1. **Combine Herbs and Oil**: Place the dried calendula flowers and comfrey leaves into a mason jar. Pour the olive or almond oil over until the herbs are completely submerged.
   
2. **Heat Gently**: Place the mason jar in a double boiler setup. Heat the mixture on low for 2-3 hours. Ensure the water in the double boiler does not boil.

3. **Cool and Strain**: After heating, allow the herbal oil to cool. Strain the mixture through cheesecloth or a fine mesh strainer into another clean jar.

### 2. Preparing the Salve Base

The base of the salve involves mixing the herbal oil with beeswax:

1. **Measure Beeswax**: For every cup of infused oil, use approximately 1/4 cup of beeswax pastilles.

2. **Melt Beeswax**: Using a clean double boiler, melt the beeswax thoroughly.

3. **Combine with Infused Oil**: Once the beeswax is completely melted, slowly add the herbal-infused oil. Stir continuously to ensure a consistent mixture.

### 3. Adding Final Touches

To enhance the healing properties and fragrance of the salve:

1. **Essential Oils**: If desired, add essential oils. Common options include 10-15 drops of lavender or tea tree oil for their additional therapeutic benefits.

2. **Stir and Pour**: Stir well to integrate the essential oils evenly. Pour the mixture into sterile containers while still warm.

### 4. Cooling and Storing

1. **Cool**: Allow the salve to cool and solidify entirely. This process can be accelerated by placing the containers in a refrigerator.

2. **Store**: Store the finished salve in a cool, dark place. Properly stored, it can last for up to a year.

## How to Use the Calendula and Comfrey Healing Salve

Apply a small amount of the salve to the affected area as needed. It is particularly effective for:

- Minor Cuts and Scrapes
- Burns and Sunburns
- Insect Bites and Stings
- Dry or Irritated Skin

## Precautions

- **Patch Test**: Always perform a patch test on a small area of skin to check for any allergic reactions.
- **Avoid Deep Wounds**: Do not use on deep wounds or puncture wounds without professional medical advice, as excessive healing could trap bacteria.
- **Pregnancy and Nursing**: Consult healthcare providers before use during pregnancy or lactation.

Creating a healing salve from calendula and comfrey is both an art and a science. It embraces the meticulousness of modern medicine and the harmonious balance of shamanic practices. This guide aims to empower you to harness natureâ€™s healing potential, bringing both ancient wisdom and current knowledge into your self-care routines.
