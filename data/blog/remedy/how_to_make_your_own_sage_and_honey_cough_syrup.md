# How to Make Your Own Sage and Honey Cough Syrup

In the vast tapestry of holistic healing, few remedies are as cherished and potent as the humble cough syrup. Today, we delve into the creation of a sage and honey cough syrup, a concoction that marries ancient shamanic wisdom with modern scientific understanding.

## Ingredients and Equipment

Before we embark on this journey, gather the following ingredients and equipment:

### Ingredients

- **Fresh Sage Leaves**: 1 cup, gently washed
- **Raw Honey**: 1 cup, preferably organic
- **Lemon**: 1, organic and freshly squeezed
- **Ginger**: 1-inch piece, finely grated
- **Echinacea Extract**: 1 teaspoon (optional but recommended for its immune-boosting properties)
- **Filtered Water**: 2 cups

### Equipment

- **Saucepan**: Medium-sized
- **Strainer or Cheesecloth**: For filtration
- **Dark Glass Bottle**: For storage
- **Measuring Cups and Spoons**
- **Stirring Spoon**

## The Healing Properties

### Sage

Sage, revered in shamanic traditions and scientifically acknowledged for its medicinal properties, is a potent herb with anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and antimicrobial benefits. It aids in soothing the throat and easing respiratory discomfort.

### Honey

Honey, particularly in its raw form, is a natural antimicrobial agent. It also acts as a demulcent, coating the throat and providing relief from irritation.

### Lemon and Ginger

Lemon is rich in Vitamin C, crucial for immune support, while ginger adds its own anti-inflammatory and expectorant properties, making this syrup a well-rounded remedy.

### Echinacea

Echinacea, optional but highly recommended, is renowned for its ability to bolster the immune system, a boon when combating respiratory ailments.

## Step-by-Step Tutorial

### Step 1: Preparing the Sage Infusion

1. **Combine Sage and Water**: In a medium-sized saucepan, combine the fresh sage leaves with 2 cups of filtered water.
2. **Simmer**: Bring the mixture to a gentle simmer over low heat. Allow it to simmer for 20 minutes, letting the sage infuse the water with its healing properties.
3. **Strain**: After 20 minutes, remove the saucepan from heat. Strain the sage infusion through a strainer or cheesecloth into a clean container, discarding the leaves.

### Step 2: Creating the Syrup Base

1. **Return to Heat**: Pour the strained sage infusion back into the saucepan.
2. **Add Honey and Ginger**: Add the cup of raw honey and the finely grated ginger to the saucepan. Stir well to combine.
3. **Simmer Again**: Bring the mixture to a gentle simmer once more. Stir occasionally, allowing the honey to fully dissolve and the ginger to infuse its properties into the syrup. Simmer for an additional 10 minutes.

### Step 3: Final Touches

1. **Add Lemon and Echinacea**: Remove the saucepan from heat. Add the freshly squeezed juice of one lemon and the teaspoon of echinacea extract (if using). Stir to incorporate these final medicinal ingredients.
2. **Cool and Bottle**: Allow the mixture to cool slightly before pouring it into a dark glass bottle for storage.

## Dosage and Storage

### Recommended Dosage

- **For Adults**: Take 1-2 tablespoons every 4-6 hours as needed.
- **For Children** (over 1 year old): Take 1-2 teaspoons every 4-6 hours as needed.

### Storage

Store the syrup in a cool, dark place or in the refrigerator. It will keep for up to 2 months, but for maximum potency, aim to use it within 4 weeks.
