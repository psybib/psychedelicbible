This guide will teach you how to make a nourishing and healing skin cream using the renowned herbs, St. John's Wort and Calendula.

## Ingredients and Materials

### Base Ingredients

  - Adds texture to the cream

- **Coconut Oil** (1/2 cup)
  - Moisturizing
  - Antibacterial

- **Almond Oil** (1/4 cup)
  - Nourishing
  - Rich in vitamins

- **Shea Butter** (2 tablespoons)
  - Deeply hydrating
  - Anti-inflammatory

### Essential Oils (Optional)

  - Calming
  - Antiseptic

- **Tea Tree Oil** (5 drops)
  - Antibacterial
  - Antifungal

### Tools
- Double boiler or a heat-safe bowl and pot
- Clean, sterilized containers (preferably glass)
- Cheesecloth or fine strainer
- Spatula for mixing

## Preparation

### Step 1: Herbal Infusion
1. **Prepare the Herbs:**
   - Dry your St. Johnâ€™s Wort and Calendula. If using fresh herbs, ensure they are fully dehydrated to prevent spoilage.

2. **Create the Oil Infusion:**
   - Fill a mason jar with equal parts dried St. John's Wort and Calendula flowers.
   - Pour almond oil over the herbs until they are fully submerged. Seal the jar tightly.

3. **Infuse the Herbs:**
   - Place the jar in a sunny window and allow it to infuse for 2-4 weeks. Shake the jar daily to ensure proper infusion.
   - Alternatively, for a quicker method, use a double boiler to gently heat the herb and oil mixture for 2-4 hours on low heat.

### Step 2: Straining and Preparing the Infused Oil
1. **Strain the Oil:**
   - Using cheesecloth or a fine strainer, filter out the plant material from the oil.
   - Squeeze the cloth to extract as much oil as possible from the herbs.

2. **Set Aside Prepared Oil:**
   - Place your freshly strained herbal oil in a clean, dry container. This will be the primary therapeutic component of your cream.

### Step 3: Making the Cream Base
1. **Melt the Base Ingredients:**
   - In a double boiler, combine the beeswax, coconut oil, and shea butter. Heat until all ingredients are fully melted and combined.

2. **Combine with Herbal Oil:**
   - Once melted, slowly stir in your herbal-infused almond oil.

3. **Add Optional Essential Oils:**
   - If desired, add essential oils like lavender and tea tree for added benefits. Mix thoroughly.

### Step 4: Finalizing Your Skin Cream
1. **Cool Down and Mix:**
   - Remove the mixture from heat and allow it to cool slightly while continuing to stir. As it cools, the mixture will start to thicken.
   
2. **Adjust Texture:**
   - If the mixture is too thick, gradually add small amounts of additional almond oil until the desired consistency is achieved.

3. **Jar and Store:**
   - Pour your cream into sterilized containers and let it cool completely before sealing.
   - Store in a cool, dark place. The cream should last up to six months.

## Best Practices and Tips

1. **Consistency is Key:**
   - Be mindful of measurements to ensure a balanced consistency. Too much beeswax will harden the cream, while too much oil will make it greasy.

2. **Hygiene:**
   - Sterilize all your tools and containers to avoid contamination.

3. **Label and Date:**
   - Always label your jars with the date of preparation to keep track of freshness.

4. **Patch Test:**
   - Since everyoneâ€™s skin is different, a patch test is advisable to rule out any allergic reactions.

5. **Personalize:**
   - Feel free to experiment with different essential oils based on your preferences or skin needs, keeping mindful of their dilutions and potential skin interactions.
