# Exploring the Psychoactive Effects of 4-MeO-DiPT

4-Methoxy-N,N-diisopropyltryptamine, commonly known as 4-MeO-DiPT, is a synthetic tryptamine that has garnered intrigue within both the scientific and psychedelic communities. As a close relative of the more well-known 5-MeO-DMT, 4-MeO-DiPT offers its unique set of psychoactive effects, making it a fascinating subject for study and experiential exploration.

## Historical Context

The origins of 4-MeO-DiPT trace back to the pioneering work of Alexander Shulgin, who first synthesized it in the late 20th century. Though it remains less popular than some other tryptamines, 4-MeO-DiPT's distinct profile has placed it under the careful gaze of psychonauts and researchers alike.

## Chemical Structure and Properties

### Chemical Composition

The chemical formula for 4-MeO-DiPT is:

```
C15H22N2O
```

Here’s a detailed breakdown of its molecular structure:

| Component         | Details                         |
|-------------------|---------------------------------|
| **IUPAC Name**    | N-[2-(4-methoxy-1H-indol-3-yl)ethyl]-N-propan-2-amine |
| **Molecular Mass**| 246.35 g/mol                    |
| **Density**       | 1.06 g/cm³                      |
| **Melting Point** | 164-165°C                       |

Its structure can be visualized as:
```
         OCH3
          |
   H2C-CH2-N(C3H7)2
          |
     /     \
    /       \
-C=CH       CH=C

 NH   -----
```

This molecule is a member of the larger indole family, sharing a core with serotonin, which partly explains its significant psychological effects.

## Psychoactive Effects

### Dosage and Administration

The effects of 4-MeO-DiPT can vary notably with dosage. Common administration routes include oral ingestion and, though less frequent, insufflation. A typical oral dose ranges from **8-30 mg**:

- **Threshold**: 2-5 mg
- **Light**: 6-12 mg
- **Common**: 13-20 mg
- **Strong**: 21-30 mg
- **Heavy**: >30 mg

**It is crucial to start with a low dose due to variability in individual sensitivity.**

### Timeline of Effects

The psychoactive timeline of 4-MeO-DiPT generally adheres to the following stages:

| **Phase**           | **Timeframe**         | **Effects**                                                    |
