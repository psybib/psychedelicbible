## üåü Building an Auto Grow Mushroom Box: A Comprehensive Guide

Growing mushrooms at home can be both rewarding and fascinating. To make the process even easier, you can build an Auto Grow Mushroom Box that automates the key conditions required for mushroom cultivation. This guide will walk you through the parts needed and the steps to assemble your very own Auto Grow Box.

## üõ†Ô∏è Auto Grow Box Parts List

### Microcontroller / Computer

Choosing the right microcontroller or computer is crucial for automating your mushroom box. Here are some options:

1. **Arduino Board ($5-$15)**

   - **Pros**: Lots of compatible parts, affordable.
   - **Cons**: Limited processing power, basic interface.
   - **Features**: Can support simple automation but might struggle with more advanced features like a web app.

2. **Raspberry Pi (Raspi) ($15-$35)**

   - **Pros**: Full-fledged computer, supports web apps, easy to adjust.
   - **Cons**: More expensive.
   - **Features**: Ideal for complex projects requiring a web app to monitor the grow process and sensors.

3. **Raspberry Pi Pico ($4)**
   - **Pros**: Very affordable, basic microcontroller.
   - **Cons**: Requires soldering, limited capability, challenging adjustments.
   - **Features**: Suitable for simple, low-cost setups without the need for a web app.

### Sensors

1. **CO2 Sensor ($2.14)**

   - **Purpose**: Measures CO2 levels to ensure proper air quality for mushroom growth.
   - **[CO2 Sensor Link](#)**

2. **Temperature and Humidity Sensor ($1.78 - $2)**

   - **Purpose**: Monitors the temperature and humidity, crucial for creating the ideal growing environment.
   - **[Temp + Humidity Sensor Link](#)**

3. **Camera ($1.10 - $5.40)**
   - **Purpose**: Optional but useful for monitoring mushroom conditions via a web app.
   - **[Camera Link](#)**

### Adjusters

1. **Mister ($1.43)**

   - **Purpose**: Provides necessary humidity for mushroom growth.
   - **[Mister Link](#)**

2. **Air Pump ($5.95)**

   - **Purpose**: Ensures proper Fresh Air Exchange (FAE).
   - **[Air Pump Link](#)**

3. **LED Lights (~$2)**
   - **Purpose**: Provides light needed for certain stages of mushroom growth, controlled via timer or microcontroller.
   - **Heater (Optional)**: Not necessary if growing in a temperature-controlled room but can be added for individual components.

### Hardware

- **Tubing**: Used for connecting various components.
- **Breadboard/Wiring**: Essential for setting up the electrical connections.
- **Box**: The main container for your mushroom grow setup.
- **Air Filters**: Helps in maintaining clean air within the grow box.
- **Soldering Iron ($10-$20)**: Required if using a microcontroller like the Raspi Pico that needs soldering.

### Additional Costs

- **Assembly**: Initial assembly time may be high, but will reduce with experience.
- **Soldering Iron**: One-time cost unless multiple people are assembling simultaneously.

## üìã Estimated Total Cost

The total cost per Auto Grow Box will depend on several factors:

- **Microcontroller Used**: Ranges from $4 to $35.
- **Additional Features**: Sensors, camera, etc.
- **Basic Hardware and Assembly**: Costs decrease as more boxes are built.

**Estimated Total Cost**: $35 - $70 per box

## üîç Research and Development

To ensure the best results, further research is needed on:

- **Ideal Temperature, Humidity, and CO2 Levels**
- **Optimal Light Cycles**
- **User Preferences from Existing Grow Boxes**
- **Sensor and Adjuster Placement**

Designing a blueprint for assembly and ensuring ease of access for harvesting are also crucial steps.

## üåê Advanced Options

### Web App Integration

Building a web dashboard to monitor CO2 levels, temperature, humidity, and camera feeds can significantly enhance the growing experience. While it adds to the complexity and cost, it offers real-time monitoring and adjustments.

### Alternative Approaches

Consider using a **Mushroom Grow Tent** for a larger, more scalable solution instead of individually regulated Auto Grow Boxes.

## üå† Step-by-Step Assembly Guide

### Step 1: Setting Up the Microcontroller

1. **Arduino Setup**:

   - Install the Arduino IDE on your computer.

   - Connect the Raspberry Pi to your network for remote access.
   - Install necessary libraries and software to interface with sensors and adjusters.

3. **Raspberry Pi Pico Setup**:
   - Solder the necessary connections for sensors and adjusters.
   - Upload the firmware to the Pico.

### Step 2: Integrating Sensors

1. **CO2 Sensor**:

   - Connect the CO2 sensor to the microcontroller.
   - Calibrate the sensor for accurate readings.

2. **Temperature and Humidity Sensor**:

   - Connect the sensor to the microcontroller.
   - Test the sensor to ensure accurate temperature and humidity readings.

3. **Camera (Optional)**:
   - Connect the camera to the microcontroller (for Raspberry Pi).
   - Configure the camera settings for optimal monitoring.

### Step 3: Setting Up Adjusters

1. **Mister**:

   - Connect the mister to the microcontroller.
   - Set up the tubing to distribute mist evenly in the grow box.

2. **Air Pump**:

   - Connect the air pump to the microcontroller.
   - Ensure proper air circulation with strategically placed air filters.

3. **LED Lights**:
   - Connect the lights to the microcontroller.
   - Set up a timer or use the microcontroller to automate the light cycles.

### Step 4: Final Assembly

1. **Wiring and Connections**:

   - Use the breadboard and wiring to connect all components.
   - Ensure all connections are secure and well-organized.

2. **Box Setup**:

   - Place all components inside the box.
   - Ensure the lid can be easily removed for maintenance and harvesting.
