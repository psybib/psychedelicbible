## Making a Homemade Herbal St. John's Wort and Calendula Salve

Are you fascinated by the magic of herbal remedies and their potential to heal and soothe? Today, we're diving into the creation of a traditional and potent herbal salve using two powerful plants: St. John's Wort (Hypericum perforatum) and Calendula (Calendula officinalis). This guide will walk you through the process step by step, ensuring you understand the therapeutic benefits and best practices for crafting your own medicinal salve at home.

### Why St. John's Wort and Calendula?

#### St. John's Wort

St. John's Wort has been revered for centuries for its remarkable healing properties. Its primary active compounds include hypericin and hyperforin, which exhibit anti-inflammatory, antiviral, and antibacterial effects. This makes it an excellent choice for treating minor wounds, burns, and skin irritations.

#### Calendula

Calendula, often called marigold, is celebrated for its skin-healing properties. The flavonoids and triterpenes in calendula offer anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial benefits, accelerating wound healing, soothing rashes, and moisturizing dry skin.

### Ingredients and Supplies

To begin, gather the following ingredients and supplies:

- **Dried St. John's Wort**: 1 cup
- **Dried Calendula Flowers**: 1 cup
- **Extra Virgin Olive Oil**: 2 cups
- **Beeswax**: 1/4 cup (or candelilla wax for a vegan option)
- **Essential Oils (Optional)**: Lavender or Tea Tree
- **Double Boiler**: Or a heatproof bowl over a pot
- **Jars or Tins**: For storing the salve
- **Cheesecloth** or a fine mesh strainer
- **Dark Glass Bottle**: For storing infused oil if you make extra

### Preparation of Infused Oil

#### Method 1: Slow Infusion (Best Method)

1. **Combine Herbs**: Place the dried St. John’s Wort and Calendula flowers into a clean, dry jar.
2. **Add Oil**: Pour extra virgin olive oil over the herbs until they are completely submerged.
3. **Infuse**: Seal the jar tightly and place it in a warm, sunny spot. Shake the jar daily to mix the herbs and oil. Allow it to infuse for 4-6 weeks for optimal potency.
4. **Strain**: After the infusion period, strain the oil through cheesecloth or a fine mesh strainer into a dark glass bottle. Discard the spent herbs.

#### Method 2: Quick Infusion (If Time-Pressed)

1. **Combine Herbs and Oil**: Place the dried herbs and oil in a double boiler.
2. **Heat Gently**: Simmer the mixture over low heat for 3-4 hours, ensuring the oil does not overheat, which could destroy beneficial properties.
3. **Strain**: After heating, strain the oil as above.

### Making the Salve

1. **Measure Oils and Wax**: Combine the infused oil and beeswax in the top part of your double boiler. For a firmer salve, you can slightly increase the amount of beeswax used.
2. **Melt**: Heat gently until the beeswax is completely melted, stirring occasionally.
3. **Optional Addition**: If using, add a few drops of essential oils such as lavender for additional soothing properties or tea tree for its antiseptic qualities.
4. **Pour into Containers**: Carefully pour the mixture into clean jars or tins before it begins to solidify. Allow it to cool completely before sealing.

### Best Practices and Tips

- **Herb Quality**: Always use high-quality, organic herbs to ensure the best medicinal properties.
- **Storage**: Store your salve in a cool, dark place to maintain its potency. Properly stored, it can last up to a year.
- **Patch Test**: Conduct a patch test before widespread use to ensure no allergic reactions.
- **Sanitation**: Ensure all containers and utensils are sterile to prevent contamination.

### Usage and Benefits

- **Minor Cuts and Scrapes**: Apply a small amount to clean skin to promote healing.
- **Burns and Sunburns**: Gently spread over the affected area for soothing relief.
- **Dry or Cracked Skin**: Regular application can help restore moisture and promote skin health.
- **Eczema and Inflammation**: The combined anti-inflammatory properties of St. John's Wort and Calendula can help reduce redness and irritation.
