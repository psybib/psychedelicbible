## Step-by-Step Synthesis Procedure

### Step 1: Formation of Eugenol

1. **Preparation:** Dissolve 100 g of catechol in 500 mL of ethanol in a flask.
2. **Methylenation:** Add 80 mL of 37% formaldehyde dropwise with constant stirring over 30 minutes.
3. **Heating:** Heat the mixture to 80°C and maintain the temperature for 2 hours.
4. **Cooling:** Let the mixture cool to room temperature.

### Step 2: Synthesis of Piperonal

1. **Oxidation:** Add 150 mL of concentrated sulfuric acid to the cooled eugenol solution.
2. **Heating:** Reflux the mixture at 90°C for 3 hours.
3. **Extraction:** After cooling, pour the mixture into 1 L of ice water and extract with ether.
4. **Drying and filtration:** Dry the ether layer over anhydrous sodium sulfate and filter.

### Step 3: p-Formylation

1. **Preparative Step:** Dissolve 50 g of piperonal in 250 mL of glacial acetic acid.
2. **Addition:** Add 50 g of ammonium chloride and 100 mL of nitroethane.
3. **Reflux:** Heat gently to 80°C for 6 hours under nitrogen atmosphere.
4. **Crystallization:** Cool the mixture and add 1 L of ice-cold water to precipitate the intermediate.

### Step 4: Reduction to MDA

1. **Reducing Agent Preparation:** Dissolve 10 g of sodium borohydride in 200 mL of ethanol in an ice bath.
2. **Addition:** Gradually add intermediate crystals to the ethanol solution.
3. **Stirring:** Stir for 4 hours at room temperature.
4. **Acidification:** Acidify with 10% HCl to pH 2, separate the organic layer using a separatory funnel.
5. **Neutralization and Extraction:** Neutralize with sodium bicarbonate, extract with ether.
6. **Drying and Filtration:** Dry ether extracts over anhydrous sodium sulfate and filter.

### Step 5: Purification

1. **Evaporation:** Use a rotary evaporator to remove ether.
2. **Crystal Formation:** Dissolve crude product in ethanol, recrystallize by adding ice-cold water.
3. **Filtration:** Collect purified MDA crystals by filtration.

## Best Practices
- **Ventilation:** Conduct procedures in a fume hood.
- **Precision:** Use a calibrated balance.
- **Incremental Addition:** Add reagents slowly to control reactions.
- **Safety Gear:** Always wear appropriate safety gear.
